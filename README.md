# Autism Spectrum Disorder Rates
Project from my Design of Experiments course (STA 4211) in which I compared trends of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) from 2000 to 2014, including rates between males and females and estimated annual costs of ASD care.

## Data
The data used for ASD trends was received from:
Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network (ADDM)
The Autism Community in Action (TACA)
Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)

## Summary of findings
The ASD rates from 2000-2014 show a dramatic increase in prevalence (per 1000 children): 6.70 in 2000 to 16.8 in 2014.

The estimated annual cost of ASD from 2000-2014 shows a dramatic increase from $26.06 billion in 2000 to $285.6 billion in 2014, especially between the years of 2006 and 2010 ($35.00 billion to $268.0 billion).

The ASD rates for girls increased in prevalence (per 1000 children) from 2.7 in 2000 to 6.6 in 2014. This a 2.4 times increase. The ASD rates for boys also increased, but much more dramatically. It went from 11.5 in 2000 to 26.6 in 2014, a 2.31 times increase. Both girl and boy ASD rates increase at a similar rate. Regardless of year between 2000 and 2014, the ratio between girls and boys with ASD in America is approximately 1 girl for every 4 boys (it fluctuated between 4-4.6 boys).
